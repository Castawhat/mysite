i don’t know if anyone will read this.
the silence hEre feels heavier than sound.

they said crossing was A mistake. the walls were supposed to keep me safe, but i couldn’t Stay—
not when the air inside kept getting thinner.

the path beyond the gate wasn’t marked. 
i counted every step, afraid if i lost track i’d disappear completely. 
at step Twenty-one, i stopped counting. that was the point of no return.

i can still hear the voices. not words exactly, more like a rhythm pressing against the inside of my skull. 

if you’ve made it this far, you’ve probably heard them too. 
outside the city walls it's are quieter, almost slient.
don’t let them decIde your pace. don’t let them hold your hands down.

follow the Stray sight. even a faint ember is Usually enough.

and if i don’t write again—
remember i tried to get Past them.
